Mining educational data to improve student orientation in university ! 
For this project, I've use all theses tools to analyze student marks dataset for my university and try to discover  what are criteria student use to choose theirs departments when they start university, after that i use sckit-learn to predict GCPA in each of students with theirs marks , the field they study and their secondary school .
I successfully predicted the CGPA by stacking 5 different regressors and get a RMSE inferior to  10\%.
And finally i'm building a web app that suggests a new student theirs orientation according to those info i use to predict the CGPA!
